            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p> I was born and raised in Houston, Texas. I then moved to Chicago, Il to attened Moody Bible Institute for my undergradute degree in Theology. After graduation I had a few options but decided to stay in the city. Before this bootcamp I was working in the logistics industry and was looking to change that up so I'm here now.</p>
            <p> I have been learning html, css, and now javascript. I have completed and published a few different projects. In Challenge 1 I refactored code to make it more concise and effecient. In Mini Project 2 I created a CSS Cheatsheet that incorporated both psuedoclasses/elements and CSS code. Mini project 1 is a webpage that demonstrates HTML and some minor CSS. I have also included the final project for the bootcamp pre-course work.      </p>
